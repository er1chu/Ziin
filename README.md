## Work in Progress

## The Bootstrap of Self-Published Zines

D.I.Y. or Don't

###This project seeks to:

1. Streamline the design and production of a 16pp saddle-stitch publication through an intuitive UI

2. Provide an outlet to share and distribute user-generated publications (tentative).

3. Automatically generate correctly collated and print-ready PDFs for users to send to print (with possible listings of local printers via geolocation)

4. Establish an archetypal format/template for produ√•cing a self-published zine for non-designers, lazy designers, parents trying to relate to their kids who just discovered Dischord Records or the Werkplaats, etc.

###Some tertiary goals or considerations would be:

1. The ability for any user to edit the previously designed booklet except for the title, regardless of the original author, thereby recontextualizing the work and questioning the notion of a book as a static entity. (lol)

2. The ability to reconfigure this app for specific contexts such as an art book fair installation.
